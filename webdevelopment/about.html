    <h3>Personal Background</h3>
    <p>Hello, my name is Nevaeh Randles! I am in my last year of undergraduate studies at the University of Missouri. My major is Interdisciplinary Studies. This program offers the freedom to study both Education and Psychology. I've also completed a minor in Linguistics, the study of language. In the last 3 years I have taught a small class briefly. <em>I've also aided in course curation for the esteemed Honors College.</em> I am currently an intern with the Honors College. I shadow advisors to gain experience in academic advising, my ideal career. Outside advising interests, I split my down time between reading, singing, and crocheting. I also spend a minimum of 2 nights a week fostering connectedness and learning within my church community. Additionally, I value spending time with my loved ones each day. No matter how busy life gets, it is nice to slow down and breathe.</p>
