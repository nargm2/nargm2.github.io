    <h3>The Goal</h3>
    <p>During my secondary school years, I developed a passion for digital design and photography. This has carried over into my tertiary education and professional experiences. This website was created to showcase the media I have produced in the last 4 years. Here you will find a collection of <em>designs related to professional development</em> from a past job as a social media assistant. Additionally, I’ve included <em>designs from my extracurricular activities,</em> ranging from eductional media to computer backgrounds. The final collection showcases <em>a variety of photos </em>taken of plants and animals. I hope that by providing a large variety of media, you can gain an understnading of my personal style.</p>
